&nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AniTrend/support-arch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AniTrend/support-arch)

This project is an attempt to create a reusable application architecture that follows some of the aspects of [Guide to App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) and is mostly written in Kotlin and makes use of [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) bundled with a couple of libraries which will be stated in the documentation.

__No external pull requests requests will be accepted until v1.2.0 stable__
